Hi there.

This is my personal site, I created it to fulfill the need of having my own place to drop notes, thoughts, pictures, or whatever I want to share on the internet. I like the concept of [Digital Gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and that's the intention I have with this site, so you probably are going to find publications that may not have sense at all, but they do for me. I also believe in the idea of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), so you are going to find a lot of "Today I Learned" (TIL) kind of notes which are short publications containing small fragments of information about something new Iâ€™ve learned.

I work as a software engineer and I have been doing so for about 10 years now, mainly focused on the backend, but I have done some frontend stuff too. I also have other interests that I explore in my free time such as reading books, writing, learning English, and exercising. 

Feel free to look around and I hope you find something useful.
