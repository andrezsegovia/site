>On the Big Web, you never own your own home. You must rent your home from Megacorps. Most often, you don’t have to pay for your home using money. You pay for it by forfeiting your privacy, freedom of speech, and your other human rights. Collectively, we pay for it by forfeiting a democratic future.1

> The Small Web is for people (not startups, enterprises, or governments). It is also made by people and small, independent organisations (not startups, enterprises, or governments).
> 
> On the Small Web, you (and only you) own and control your own home (or homes).

> On the Small Web, we do not have the concept of “users”. When we refer to people, we call them people.

> Our vision for the future is one where every person owns and controls their own place on our shared global network. This is the only way to ensure that we have a public sphere, human rights, and democracy in the digital network era.
