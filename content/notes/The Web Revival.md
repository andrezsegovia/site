> Surfing the web is about going on an adventure, it's about clicking links and seeing where they go. You won't find Web Revival sites on typical search engines, you won't find them on social media sites and no algorithm will pick them out for you. To surf the Web Revival, you start on one site, you find links and you follow the trail; be brave, explore, keep going, keep going![^1]

I've been thinking that there is a whole, more interesting version of the Internet outside of the popular social media platforms. Those platforms are mainly focused on monetization, so it is likely that the content we find there is not the best for us, but rather the best maximizing profits.

Lately, I've found myself truly surfing the web -following link after link, going deeper and deeper- and I've enjoyed it while learning a lot in the process, such as this new concept/movement of the web revival.
