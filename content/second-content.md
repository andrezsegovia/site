Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.


But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.

I said once at a conference that you can’t outsource giving a shit - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You can outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.

My average client engagement is over two years. Average! I have some clients where I’ve been working with them longer than most of their full time employees.

Is this giving a shit? I think so.
